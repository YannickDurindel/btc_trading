First off, I am happy to tell you that these code will only make you dream but won't make you rich, just like it did for me for 7 months...
A repo where I post all my work I've been doing for almost 6 months on a trading bot. 
I coded only in python, I used the platform on coinbase, and then of binance. Wich means you will need to create a binance account if you want to make it happend : here is a great tuto that I used to set up your binance API : https://algotrading101.com/learn/binance-python-api-guide/

B E W A R E : You should understand the whole code if you want to use these irl. The author doesn't take any responsablility if those make you loose money. This isn't a game, this is real stuff, should be take seriously.
Notice that irl, there are commisions on any platforms of trading, which is why you can't actually make it work, all the money you'll make , you'll be giving it to the trading platform...

NB : I let old ID and passwords, none of them are still working, just to save your time trying to hack me ;)
