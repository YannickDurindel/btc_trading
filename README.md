# btc_trading
A repo where I post all my work I've been doing for almost 6 months on a trading bot. 
I coded only in python, I used the platform on coinbase, and then of binance. 

B E W A R E : You should understand the whole code if you want to use these irl. The author doesn't take any responsablility if those make you loose money. This isn't a game, this is real stuff, should be take seriously.
Notice that irl, there are commisions on any platforms of trading, which is why you can't actually make it work, all the money you'll make , you'll be giving it to the trading platform...

currently filling it, I made over a hundred codes...
